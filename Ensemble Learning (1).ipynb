    "- During tree construction:\n",
    "  - At each node, instead of considering **all features** to find the best split,\n",
    "  - The algorithm randomly selects **a subset of features** (say ‚àön features out of n),\n",

    "2. **Train Multiple Regressors**:\n",
    "   - Train a **base regressor** (e.g., a decision tree) on each bootstrap sample independently.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Improved Accuracy**  \n",
    "   - Combining several models (e.g., trees, classifiers) reduces the chance of error and typically leads to better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Reduced Overfitting**  \n",
    "   - Techniques like bagging (e.g., Random Forest) help prevent overfitting by averaging out predictions from multiple models.\n",

    "2. **Reduced Interpretability**\n",
    "   - It‚Äôs harder to understand and explain how an ensemble (like Random Forest or Gradient Boosting) makes predictions compared to a single model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Size and Storage**\n",
    "   - Ensembles often require more memory and disk space because they store several models.\n",

    "4. **Longer Inference Time**\n",
    "   - Making predictions can be slower since many models must contribute their outputs.\n",

    "## Key Idea Behind Ensemble Techniques\n",

    "   \n",
    "2. **Random Feature Selection**:\n",
    "   - When constructing each decision tree, a **random subset of features** is considered for splitting at each node (instead of using all features). This helps in making the trees more diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Training Multiple Trees**:\n",
    "   - Each tree is trained independently on its bootstrap sample and with its randomly selected features.\n",

    "- **Reason**: Ensemble methods require sufficient data to perform well. When dealing with small datasets, models may not have enough variation in the data for an ensemble to provide significant improvements.\n",
    "- **Why Avoid**: Small datasets are more prone to overfitting, and using ensembles may just amplify the noise in the data rather than providing any meaningful improvements.\n",

    "- **Complexity**: They may be unnecessary for simple problems.\n",
    "- **Resource Usage**: They require more computational power.\n",
    "- **Interpretability**: They reduce model transparency.\n",

    "16. How does Bagging help in reducing overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variance Reduction**:\n",
    "  - Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and sensitive to noise in the training data (high variance).\n",
    "  - Bagging trains multiple models on different subsets and aggregates their outputs, smoothing out the noise.\n",
    "  - The combined model generalizes better than individual overfitted models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Independence**:\n",
    "  - Each model sees a slightly different dataset and hence makes different errors.\n",
    "  - Aggregation helps cancel out these errors, making the final prediction more robust.\n",
